# Build With Predefined HTML Classes
vimeo: This will ensure that we don't add extra padding since Vimeo has controls within the player, itself.

```html
<div class="flex-video">
  <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0_EW8aNgKlA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```
For these styles to come across, make sure you have the default Foundation CSS package or that you've selected flex-video from a custom package. These should be linked up following our default HTML page structure.
