  - title: LAUNCHING
    description: Based on years of practice, we smoothly and painlessly integrate
      our team into your ongoing project. They continuously work only for your project,
      get to know its specifics, and see the general idea behind each separate task.
      You can choose the preferred management approach. Team members become part of
      your company and, with the others, adhere to the client’s corporate culture,
      management style, and project methodologies.

  title: Benefits of Dedicated Team model
  items:
  - title: Cost-effectiveness
    description: Choosing a dedicated team model is economically viable. Aside from
      incomparable differences between the cost of dedicated teams and in-house developers,
      it is also more profitable than project-based models of cooperation.  This depends
      largely on the specification of the project and the size of the dedicated team,
      which makes the price for this model lower by 10-20%.
  - title: Maximum focus on the client’s project
    description: An important advantage of a dedicated team is its full involvement
      in solution development.The vendor thus provides a team that is not easily distracted
      by working on other projects that lead to the increased adaptability of team
      members. It allows clients to easily reconfigure the team at any stage of the
      working process as required.
  - title: The team is fully managed by the client
    description: Another advantage of a dedicated team model is the possibility for
      clients to select, and manage every working process of a dedicated team. There
      are software engineers, quality assurance specialists, UI/UX designers and a
      project manager at the client’s disposal.
  - title: Tight-knit work of client and team
    description: The actual primary thing businesses gain from dedicated teams is
      that this type of collaboration creates an atmosphere of team building where
      every member is led to achieving common goals. It allows for long-term work
      planning more accurately and invests in the project by contributing more effort.
      The close-knit collaboration between the client and a dedicated team can bear
      incredibly tangible results.
