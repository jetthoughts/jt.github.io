  - title: How outstaffing works
    description: |-
      Outstaffing presupposes extending your in-house team with remote workers with the help of a third-party vendor company.

      Using this strategy, your business may recruit individual highly talented developers from external vendors to briefly expand in-house departments over a project period.

      The process of outstaffing might be known to you like the process of hiring a contractor.
