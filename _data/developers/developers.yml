  development:
    item_1: Your software will be built by a small team of 2-6 developers, breaking the work into one-week development cycles (called “sprints”).
    item_2: The progress is visible every day - you will get a report from each developer along with commits and timesheets.
    item_3: At the end of each sprint, you will receive a working piece of software as well as daily releases with new changes.
    item_4: No waiting for big releases. No wondering when your project will be finished.
  guarantee:
    item_1: You’re not committing to lump sums to be paid for a pig in a poke. We operate on a monthly subscription service.
    item_2: We offer a 2-week trial period to see how it goes, no financial risks to hire a team, and test everything.
    item_3: Regardless of the project complexity or size, we allow a ONE-day notice to add new developers, decrease the budget, or stop the contract.
    item_4: No liaisons or supervisors involved in the development; you can communicate with every developer directly and get the answers needed.
dev_trial_period:
  description: The trial period will take 2 weeks. If everything is okay, after 2 weeks, we request our first payment and continue working. If something goes wrong and you are unsatisfied with us - you pay nothing.
