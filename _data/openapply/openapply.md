  description: (FEG)’s OpenApply product needed to accommodate increasing demand, but the code contained a multitude of bugs. Internally, FEG wasn’t equipped to address the growing issue or to meet customer demands for a better UI experience.

  title: Seamlessly Connecting Schools with Prospects
  description: If you’ve ever gone through a school admissions process, you know just how arduous it can be. You have to deal with paperwork, essays, tests, interviews, and likely much more. It can be overwhelming – and that’s not even considering the anxiety of waiting to find out if you got in. With all of that in mind, FEG created OpenApply, an online platform to help simplify the admissions and enrollment processes for applicants around the world. OpenApply supports international schools by providing a paperless, integrated, and seamless online system that helps ease the stress of everyone involved.
