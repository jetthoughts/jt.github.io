        <p class="message text-left">A starting point of your project is the initial idea. To begin with, you share your thoughts, notes and stories with us to understand your vision and desired outcome. Then we interview you for your business goals and compile requirements. During the negotiation process we discuss your preliminary budget and timeline. As a result we create User stories and Wireframes for your application.

Prioritizing is highly important during the development process. That is why we usually plan the set of tasks for the following week (Sprints) in a close cooperation with you. In the end of each Sprint you have an opportunity to review working product.</p>
        <p class="message text-left">Our goal is to keep you up with your project 24\7. Constant interaction and communication between you and our manager is realized by means of project management software, live chat, email, voice and video conference calls.</p>
        <p class="message text-left">When the code is ready, our testers try to detect and eliminate any possible problems. We make sure that your application is working properly, ensuring an error-free launch.</p>
